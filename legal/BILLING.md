# Billing & Refund Policy

Effective: 2025‑08‑20

## Plans
- Free – basic access, limited features
- Pro – single seat, higher limits, priority email support
- Team – includes 5 seats; additional seats billed per seat

## Subscriptions & Billing
- Subscriptions are billed via Stripe. Prices are immutable; we introduce new prices rather than changing old ones.
- Team plan seats are managed via subscription quantity. Quantity changes prorate per Stripe rules.

## Refunds & Cancellations
- Annual (first‑time): 7‑day no‑questions refund. Contact support with your receipt.
- Monthly: same‑day mistake purchases may be prorated; otherwise cancel at period end (no refunds).
- Team seats: quantity changes prorate. Downgrades take effect at period end unless otherwise requested.

## Manage Billing
Use the in‑app “Manage billing” link to update payment methods, download invoices, or cancel.

## Dunning & Grace Periods
We use Stripe Smart Retries and automated emails for failed payments. When a payment fails, we show an in‑app banner to update your payment method via the Portal. Access may be limited if payments remain unpaid after retries.
