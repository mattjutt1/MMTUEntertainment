# Ads, Affiliates & Endorsements Disclosures

_Last updated: 2025‑08‑20_

We follow the U.S. FTC’s **Endorsement Guides (16 CFR Part 255, revised 2023)** and staff guidance. Everyone creating content for MMTU (employees, contractors, affiliates, creators) must use **clear and conspicuous** disclosures whenever there is a **material connection** to a product or service we feature (payment, free product, affiliate links, revenue share, family/employment ties, etc.).

## Core Rules (apply everywhere)
1) **Say it so people notice & understand it.** Place the disclosure near the claim—**not** hidden in footers, profiles, or only in a bio.  
2) **Use simple words.** Examples that generally work: **“Ad,” “Advertisement,” “Paid partnership,” “Sponsored,” “We earn commissions from links.”** Avoid ambiguous tags like **“#sp,” “#spon,” “ambassador”** alone.  
3) **Match the medium:**
   - **Video:** verbal **and** on‑screen at the start and when making claims; keep it visible long enough to read.
   - **Live/Stories/Reels/Shorts:** keep disclosures on screen when endorsing; repeat for new segments.
   - **Audio/Podcasts:** say the disclosure clearly **before** or when making claims.
   - **Space‑limited posts:** use “Ad” or “Paid partnership” up front.
   - **Reviews & ratings:** disclose when we gave incentives or have relationships that may affect credibility.
4) **Kids/teens:** make disclosures even more obvious and age‑appropriate.

## Examples (copyable)
- Blog/video: “This video is **sponsored** by Acme. Our opinions are our own.”  
- Affiliate links: “We may **earn a commission** if you buy through links on this page.”  
- Free product: “Acme **sent us this product for free**.”

## Placement Standards
- **On MMTU web pages:** put the disclosure **directly above** or **within** the endorsement claim (not just in the footer).  
- **Apps & in‑product UI:** show a short disclosure adjacent to the claim; link “Learn more → Disclosures.”  
- **Social posts:** first lines/overlay; not after a “more” cutoff.

## Enforcement
- We review content for compliance. Violations may be removed and creators off‑boarded.
