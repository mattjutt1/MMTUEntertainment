# DESIGN PRINCIPLES - $0 BUSINESS OPERATIONS

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

**"The system works because you use it, not because you optimize it."**

## THE 10 PRINCIPLES

### 1. FALSIFIABLE BEGINNING
- START.yml with UTC timestamp = objective start
- Either exists or doesn't (no ambiguity)
- Irreversible commitment (no moving/renaming)

### 2. EVIDENCE OVER INTENTIONS
- Every action → log.jsonl entry with timestamp
- Counting replaces feeling ("Am I making progress?")
- Text files = permanent, versionable proof

### 3. CONSTRAINTS AS FEATURES
- $0 budget eliminates tool-shopping paralysis
- 5 files limit complexity/decisions
- 20-minute timer prevents perfectionism

### 4. TIMER BEATS FEELINGS
- External time limit > internal "done enough" sense
- Forces shipping imperfect work
- Creates sustainable daily habit

### 5. RULES REPLACE JUDGMENT  
- 5 anti-spiral rules remove decision points
- Violations logged and penalized
- Automation enforces discipline

### 6. LOCAL FIRST, ALWAYS
- No external dependencies/accounts
- Works offline forever
- You own your data/evidence

### 7. PLAIN TEXT SUPREMACY
- Human readable without special software
- Version controllable, backupable, searchable
- Future-proof (outlasts any proprietary format)

### 8. MINIMAL SURFACE AREA
- 5 files total (can fit in your head)
- 1 main workflow (daily loop)
- Limited failure modes

### 9. MECHANICAL PROCESSES
- "Add one line" = always the answer to doubt
- Fixed formats eliminate design decisions
- Repetition builds automaticity

### 10. USAGE BEFORE OPTIMIZATION
- 14-day freeze on improvements
- Count metrics only (not quality/elegance)
- System must prove value through use

## ANTI-PATTERNS PREVENTED

| Common Trap | How System Prevents |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "Perfect tool" research | $0 constraint, plain text only |
| Analysis paralysis | 20-min timer, 70% decision rule |
| Feature creep | 5-file limit, no redesign until Day 14 |
| "Not really started" feeling | START.yml timestamp proof |
| Overwhelming complexity | Minimal surface area |
| External dependencies | Local text files only |
| Procrastination excuses | No setup required, works immediately |

## SYSTEM BOUNDARIES

### ALLOWED:
- ✓ Add lines to existing files
- ✓ Run provided scripts
- ✓ Count numbers going up
- ✓ Work within time limits

### FORBIDDEN (until Day 14):
- ❌ Create new files/folders
- ❌ Rename existing files
- ❌ Add new features/tools
- ❌ Optimize the process
- ❌ Work beyond time limits

## SUCCESS METRICS

1. **Behavioral**: Daily 20-minute sessions
2. **Quantitative**: Notes/triage counts increasing  
3. **Temporal**: Consistent evidence in log.jsonl
4. **Financial**: $0 spent throughout

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

When facing any choice in the system:
1. Does it cost money? → NO
2. Does it require external accounts? → NO  
3. Does it increase file count? → NO
4. Does it take >20 minutes? → NO
5. Does it optimize vs use? → NO

If any answer is YES → Don't do it.

**Remember**: These principles exist to prevent the meta-work that stops the actual work.
