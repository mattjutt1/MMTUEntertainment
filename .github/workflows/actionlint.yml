# CI NOTE â€” why we gate at the JOB level (not workflow level)
# - Skipping a WORKFLOW via branch/path filters can leave its check "Pending" and block merges.  (GitHub)
#   https://docs.github.com/actions/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs
# - Skipping a JOB via an `if:` condition reports "Success/neutral" and won't block merges.     (GitHub)
#   https://docs.github.com/actions/using-jobs/using-conditions-to-control-job-execution
# - We use dorny/paths-filter to decide per-job if lint should run.                             (GitHub Action)

# - Branch protection accepts successful/skipped/neutral states for required checks.           (GitHub)

# - Concurrency cancels stale runs to save CI minutes.                                         (GitHub)
