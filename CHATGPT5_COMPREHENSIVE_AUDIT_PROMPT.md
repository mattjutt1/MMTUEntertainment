## Primary Audit Directive

You are performing a **forensic-level audit** of MMTU Entertainment's monorepo with specific focus on **revenue generation viability** and **technical integrity**. This is a high-stakes assessment where fabrications, mock data, or unrealistic projections could derail actual income generation.

**Core Philosophy**: "No drift, money-first, evidence-based execution"

---

## Part 1: Technical Integrity Audit (High Reasoning Effort)

### 1.1 Fabrication Detection

Think deeply about each component and identify:

1. **Mock Data Masquerading as Real**:
   - Scan `/scripts/gatekeeper.ts` - are the metrics calculations actually connected to real analytics?
   - Review `/packages/analytics/src/index.ts` - do these events actually fire to PostHog or are they console.log stubs?
   - Examine `/packages/feature-flags/` - is Supabase actually configured or is it using localStorage fallbacks?
   - Check `.orchestrator/runlog.jsonl` - are these real execution logs or fabricated entries?

2. **Unimplemented Critical Paths**:
   - Does the bundle upsell timer actually countdown and persist state?
   - Are the pricing arms ($9/$19) actually bucketing users deterministically?
   - Is the GitHub marketplace webhook handler actually receiving/processing events?
   - Does the gatekeeper DENY actually block flag promotions in production?

3. **Test Coverage Reality**:
   - Are the "100 E2E tests" actually written and passing?
   - Do the Playwright tests actually interact with real components or mock everything?
   - Is the CI/CD pipeline actually enforcing quality gates?

### 1.2 Refactoring Requirements Analysis

Apply Claude Code best practices to identify technical debt:

```
For each major component, assess:
- Complexity score (cyclomatic/cognitive)
- Duplication percentage
- Coupling metrics
- Test coverage gaps
- Security vulnerabilities
```

Priority refactoring targets:
1. Files with complexity >15
2. Duplicate code blocks >20 lines
3. Components with <80% test coverage
4. Any hardcoded secrets or API keys

## Part 2: Revenue Viability Assessment (Maximum Verbosity)

### 2.1 Real Income Path Analysis

**Provide a 500+ word assessment** answering:

1. **Bundle Upsell Reality Check**:
   - Is the 3% attach rate realistic for a $199 bundle post-$29 purchase?
   - Are the 5 reports actually valuable enough to command premium pricing?
   - What's the actual implementation cost vs projected revenue?

2. **Pricing Experiment Validity**:
   - Is the $9 vs $19 test statistically powered correctly?
   - Will 1000 visitors actually convert at expected rates?
   - Are we measuring the right metrics for pricing decisions?

3. **GitHub Marketplace Potential**:
   - Is DriftGuard differentiated enough to achieve 10% install rate?
   - Are the security checks actually valuable vs existing tools?
   - What's the realistic DAU/MAU for a GitHub App in this space?

### 2.2 Competitive Intelligence

Research and report on:
- Similar products' pricing and conversion rates
- GitHub Marketplace average install rates by category
- Bundle attach rates in comparable SaaS products

---

## Part 3: Strategic Recommendations (Chain-of-Thought)

### 3.1 Go/No-Go Decision Matrix

Think step by step through each revenue stream:

```
For each opportunity (Bundle/Pricing/Marketplace):
1. Technical readiness score (0-100)
2. Market validation evidence
3. Risk assessment (low/medium/high)
4. 30-day revenue projection (realistic)
5. Resource requirements to ship
6. GO or NO-GO recommendation with reasoning
```

### 3.2 Critical Path to First Dollar

**Detailed action plan** with:
- Day 1-7: Immediate fixes for showstoppers
- Day 8-14: MVP launch requirements
- Day 15-30: Optimization and scaling
- Specific metrics to track success/failure

---

## Part 4: Code Quality Deep Dive

### 4.1 Architectural Assessment

Analyze the monorepo structure:
- Is the workspace configuration optimal?
- Are the package boundaries correctly defined?
- Is there unnecessary coupling between packages?
- Are the build/deployment scripts production-ready?

### 4.2 Security Audit

High-priority checks:
- Any exposed API keys or secrets?
- SQL injection vulnerabilities?
- XSS attack vectors in the UI?
- Proper authentication/authorization?
- GDPR/privacy compliance for analytics?

## Part 5: Reality Check Questions

**Answer with brutal honesty**:

1. **The $10K Question**: Based on current code state, can this realistically generate $10K in the next 90 days? If not, what's blocking it?

2. **The Fabrication Factor**: What percentage of the claimed functionality is actually implemented vs mocked/stubbed? Give a number.

3. **The Pivot Point**: Should we continue down this path or pivot to something simpler that ships faster?

4. **The Resource Reality**: Given current velocity, how many engineering hours to reach production-ready state?

5. **The Market Truth**: Is there actual demand for these products or are we building in a vacuum?

---

## Part 6: Evidence Requirements

For each major claim, provide:
1. **File path + line numbers** where functionality exists
2. **Test results** proving it works
3. **Metrics/logs** showing actual usage
4. **External validation** (competitor analysis, market data)

Red flags to specifically check:
- Gatekeeper DENY at line 107 - does it actually prevent changes?
- PostHog integration - are events reaching the dashboard?
- Supabase flags - is real-time sync working?
- GitHub webhooks - are they configured and receiving?

---

## Output Format

## Meta Instructions

- **Think deeply** before answering (use high reasoning_effort)
- **Be verbose** in explanations (high verbosity for evidence)
- **Challenge assumptions** - don't accept claims without proof
- **Follow the money** - every feature should tie to revenue
- **No sugarcoating** - brutal honesty about viability

Remember: The goal is **real revenue**, not beautiful code. Every recommendation should move us closer to **shipping and earning**.
