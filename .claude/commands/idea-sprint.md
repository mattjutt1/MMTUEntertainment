# /idea-sprint

**Command**: `/idea-sprint`
**Category**: Innovation & Product Development
**Purpose**: Rapid ideation and concept validation sprint with structured creative process
**Wave-enabled**: true
**Performance-profile**: optimization

## Description

Execute intensive ideation sprint to generate, evaluate, and validate innovative concepts using structured creative methodologies and rapid prototyping.

## Sprint Structure

### Phase 1: Divergent Thinking (30 minutes)
- **Brainstorming**: Generate 50+ raw ideas without judgment
- **Mind Mapping**: Explore concept relationships and connections
- **Analogical Thinking**: Draw inspiration from other industries/domains
- **Constraint Removal**: "What if" scenarios with unlimited resources

### Phase 2: Idea Synthesis (20 minutes)
- **Clustering**: Group related concepts and identify themes
- **Combination**: Merge complementary ideas for hybrid solutions
- **Abstraction**: Extract core principles and underlying patterns
- **Refinement**: Develop most promising concepts with detail

### Phase 3: Evaluation Framework (15 minutes)
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Technical complexity, resource requirements
- **Market Potential**: Addressable market, customer pain points
- **Differentiation**: Unique value proposition, competitive advantage
- **Impact Scoring**: Potential return on investment and strategic alignment

### Phase 4: Rapid Prototyping (45 minutes)
- **Concept Validation**: Quick mockups, wireframes, or proof-of-concept
- **User Story Development**: Core user journeys and value delivery
- **Technical Architecture**: High-level system design and dependencies
- **Go-to-Market Strategy**: Distribution channels and customer acquisition

## Ideation Techniques

### Creative Methods
- **SCAMPER**: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse
- **Six Thinking Hats**: Multiple perspective analysis (logical, creative, critical, etc.)
- **Crazy 8s**: 8 ideas in 8 minutes for rapid generation
- **Worst Possible Idea**: Reverse brainstorming to unlock creative thinking

### Analytical Methods
- **Jobs-to-be-Done**: What job is the customer hiring this solution to do?
- **Blue Ocean Strategy**: Create uncontested market space
- **Design Thinking**: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test
- **Lean Startup**: Build-Measure-Learn cycle for validation

### Technology-Driven Methods
- **AI/ML Applications**: How can emerging tech solve existing problems?
- **API Mashups**: Combine existing services in novel ways
- **Platform Thinking**: Multi-sided market opportunities
- **Automation Opportunities**: What manual processes can be automated?
