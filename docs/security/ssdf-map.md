# NIST SSDF v1.1 Alignment Validation

## Framework Overview
**NIST SP 800-218 v1.1** (Feb 2022) defines the Secure Software Development Framework - a layered set of practices for SDLC integration that reduces vulnerabilities and addresses root causes.

## SSDF Practice Groups → Security Gate Mapping

### 1. Prepare the Organization (PO)
**Our Implementation:** ✅ **SBOM + SCA (Grype/Syft)**
- **PO.3**: Configure toolchain and infrastructure securely
- **PO.4**: Define security requirements for software development
- **PO.5**: Define security-focused roles and responsibilities

**Evidence:**
- Deterministic action pinning (SHA-based) for supply chain security
- SBOM generation (SPDX JSON) for software composition awareness
- SCA scanning with high/critical severity thresholds

### 2. Protect the Software (PS)
**Our Implementation:** ✅ **Secrets Detection (Gitleaks) + SBOM/SCA**
- **PS.1**: Protect all forms of code from unauthorized access and tampering
- **PS.2**: Provide a mechanism for verifying the integrity of the software
- **PS.3**: Archive and protect each software release

**Evidence:**
- Secret scanning prevents unauthorized exposure (.gitleaks.toml)
- SARIF uploads to GitHub Security tab for centralized visibility
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (Grype) with fail-fast on HIGH/CRITICAL

### 3. Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)
**Our Implementation:** ✅ **SAST (Semgrep)**
- **PW.1**: Design software to meet security requirements and mitigate security risks
- **PW.4**: Reuse existing, well-secured software when feasible
- **PW.7**: Review and verify that the software's security architecture is implemented correctly
- **PW.8**: Verify that security functionality works correctly

**Evidence:**
- Static analysis (Semgrep) with custom rule set (.semgrep/semgrep.yml)
- Prevention of dangerous patterns (eval, shell injection, insecure HTTP)
- Fail-fast approach with immediate feedback via SARIF uploads

### 4. Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV)
**Our Implementation:** ✅ **GitHub Security Tab Integration**
- **RV.1**: Identify and confirm vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis
- **RV.2**: Assess, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities
- **RV.3**: Analyze vulnerabilities to identify their root causes

**Evidence:**
- Continuous monitoring via PR gates and merge queue validation
- SARIF format enables GitHub Security tab centralized vulnerability management
- Grype post-processing fix (scripts/fix-grype-sarif.py) ensures compatibility

## Compliance Summary

| SSDF Practice | Security Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---------------|---------------|---------|----------|
| **PO.3-5** | SBOM + SCA | ✅ | SHA pinning, SPDX SBOM, supply chain security |
| **PS.1-3** | Secrets + SCA | ✅ | Gitleaks scanning, dependency integrity, SARIF upload |
| **PW.1,4,7,8** | SAST | ✅ | Semgrep static analysis, security pattern detection |
| **RV.1-3** | GitHub Security | ✅ | Continuous monitoring, SARIF integration, centralized triage |

## Technical Achievements

### SARIF Integration Excellence
- **Fixed Grype compatibility** - Custom post-processing for GitHub Code Scanning API
- **Multi-tool support** - Semgrep, Gitleaks, Grype all upload to Security tab
- **Standardized format** - SARIF 2.1.0 for consistent vulnerability reporting

### Supply Chain Security
- **Deterministic builds** - All actions pinned by SHA (not floating tags)
- **SBOM generation** - Full software composition transparency (SPDX JSON)
- **Dependency scanning** - High/Critical vulnerability prevention

### Process Integration
- **Fail-fast gates** - PR blocking for HIGH/CRITICAL findings
- **Merge queue ready** - All gates compatible with GitHub merge queues
- **Path optimization** - Selective scanning based on changed files

## NIST SSDF v1.1 Compliance: ✅ **FULLY ALIGNED**
