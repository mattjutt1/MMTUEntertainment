# Phase 4 Plan â€“ Post-Foundation Development

## âœ… Current State (as of PR #45)
- CI & Branch Protection enforced: `Site E2E Smoke Tests (â‰¤3min)`, `Prompt Contract Lint`
- Proof run PR #46 validated gate behavior (passes green, blocks red)
- Smoke tests consistently â‰¤3min
- 16 stale PRs closed; only foundation-forward PRs active
- Tracking Issues:
  - #47 Unquarantine flaky tests (medium)
  - #48 Fix failing scan jobs (low)

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 4 Goals
1. Throughput first â€“ branch from main, keep PRs small/merge fast
2. Test reliability â€“ resolve #47, restore full coverage
3. CI signal cleanliness â€“ address #48, ensure only meaningful failures
4. Developer velocity â€“ maintain â‰¤3min smoke lane; add troubleshooting docs

## ðŸ“ˆ ROI
- Protects ARR by ensuring stable revenue paths
- Increases PR throughput and reduces wasted cycles
- Retention boost via consistent foundation

## ðŸ›¡ Rollback
- If smoke gate flaky â†’ temporarily uncheck required status; restore <24h
- If branch protection misconfigured â†’ edit settings to correct required checks
