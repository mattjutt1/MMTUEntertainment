# Final Mixed-Change Verification

**Date**: Fri Aug 22 06:54:00 UTC 2025
**Purpose**: Ultimate test of corrected logic for mixed changes (site + docs)

**Critical Test**: This PR changes both:
- `products/site/playwright.config.ts` (site change)
- `docs/verification-final.md` (docs change)

**Expected Behavior with Corrected Logic**:
- Path filter outputs: `site_changed=true`, `docs_only=true` 
- Workflow execution: **FULL E2E TESTS** (≤3min runtime)
- Steps: All E2E steps execute (Checkout → Setup → Install → Build → Test → Upload)
- Result: SUCCESS with E2E execution (NOT noop)

**This is the definitive test proving PR #54 fixed the mixed-change logic bug.**
