## Pabrai Governance Discipline

### Concentration Principle
- **≤3 active bets** maximum at any time
- Other initiatives parked in "Backlog" status  
- Active = receiving development time this 4-week cycle

### Kill/Scale Cycle (Every 4 Weeks)
- Review all active bets for continuation
- Kill: No clear progress toward upside case
- Scale: Strong signals, increase resource allocation
- Park: Promising but not top-3 priority

### Circle of Competence
Core strengths only:
- CI/E2E infrastructure and testing
- Stripe membership integration
- Cloudflare deployment and optimization
- Community/forum development

### Asymmetric Bet Criteria
1. **Downside cap**: Limited to ≤2 weeks development time
2. **Upside potential**: Clear path to 10× business impact
3. **Reversibility**: Can be undone without lasting damage
4. **Learning value**: Generates actionable business intelligence

## Core Revenue Rules

### Revenue Focus
- LTV:CAC ≥ 3.0 (target)
- Week 4 Retention ≥ 20% (target)  
- Gross Margin ≥ 60% (target)
- Smoke Conversion ≥ 5% (minimum)

### Resource Management
- Keep: Revenue-generating potential OR supporting infrastructure
- Archive: Low-impact assets, experimental code, unused dependencies
- Delete: Security risks, broken dependencies, duplicate functionality

### Decision Framework
1. **Revenue Impact**: Does this directly contribute to customer acquisition or retention?
2. **Technical Debt**: Is this creating maintenance overhead?
3. **Business Focus**: Does this align with our core business model?

### Implementation Principles
- Document before delete
- Measure before optimize  
- Validate before scale
- Automate before hire

## Enforcement Mechanisms
- PR template requires bet framing
- Weekly digest tracks active bet count  
- Project board enforces ≤3 active status
- 4-week review cycles scheduled automatically

## Kill/Scale Decision Framework

### Kill Triggers
- No measurable progress in 4 weeks
- Downside risk exceeding cap
- Outside circle of competence  
- Better opportunities identified

### Scale Triggers  
- Clear 10× upside evidence
- Strong user/revenue signals
- Synergy with existing strengths
- Sustainable competitive advantage
