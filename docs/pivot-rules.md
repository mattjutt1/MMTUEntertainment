## Core Rules

### Revenue Focus
- LTV:CAC ≥ 3.0 (target)
- Week 4 Retention ≥ 20% (target)  
- Gross Margin ≥ 60% (target)
- Smoke Conversion ≥ 5% (minimum)

### Resource Management
- Keep: Revenue-generating potential OR supporting infrastructure
- Archive: Low-impact assets, experimental code, unused dependencies
- Delete: Security risks, broken dependencies, duplicate functionality

### Decision Framework
1. **Revenue Impact**: Does this directly contribute to customer acquisition or retention?
2. **Technical Debt**: Is this creating maintenance overhead?
3. **Business Focus**: Does this align with our core business model?

### Implementation Principles
- Document before delete
- Measure before optimize  
- Validate before scale
- Automate before hire
