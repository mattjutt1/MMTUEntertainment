# ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System Implementation Checklist

## Purpose
Establish, maintain, and continually improve a quality management system to consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements while enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Inputs
- Customer requirements and satisfaction feedback
- Applicable statutory and regulatory requirements
- Organizational context (internal/external factors, stakeholders)
- Leadership commitment and quality policy
- Competency requirements and training needs

## Outputs
- Quality management system documentation and processes
- Product/service conformity evidence and customer deliverables
- Performance monitoring reports and management review outputs  
- Nonconformity reports with corrective/preventive actions
- Internal audit findings and improvement opportunities

## Automation Primitives
1. **Document Control**: Version management with approval workflows and obsolete tracking
2. **Nonconformity/CAPA**: Issue intake with root cause analysis and action tracking
3. **Internal Audits**: Scheduled programs with findings follow-up and corrective actions
4. **Management Review**: Systematic input collection with output and action tracking  
5. **KPI/Risk Monitoring**: Process performance tracking with risk assessment integration

## Implementation Risks
- **Documentation Overload**: Creating excessive procedures without adding value
- **Audit Theatre**: Compliance activities without real process improvement
- **CAPA Ineffectiveness**: Superficial corrective actions that don't prevent recurrence
- **Leadership Disengagement**: Management review becoming routine paperwork exercise
- **Customer Focus Loss**: Internal compliance taking priority over customer satisfaction
