# PDSA Cycle Implementation Checklist

## Purpose
Drive continual improvement through systematic Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles that test predictions against actual results, emphasizing learning guided by theory rather than simple success/failure.

## Inputs
- Theory or hypothesis about improvement opportunity
- Baseline measurements and current state data
- Success criteria and prediction of expected results  
- Small-scale test environment or pilot area
- Stakeholders affected by the change

## Outputs
- Validated or revised theory based on actual results vs predictions
- Learning documentation for organizational knowledge
- Implementation plan for successful changes
- Standardized procedures (if adopting change)
- Next cycle planning (if iterating or abandoning)

## Automation Primitives  
1. **Experiment Design**: Hypothesis definition with metrics and plan metadata
2. **Run Execution**: Automated data collection during do phase
3. **Study Analytics**: Compare predicted vs observed with statistical analysis
4. **Decision Gates**: Act phase workflows to adopt/abandon/iterate
5. **Learning Repository**: Link cycles and outcomes for organizational memory

## Implementation Risks
- **PDCA vs PDSA Confusion**: Focusing on implementation success rather than learning
- **Theory-Free Testing**: Running experiments without clear predictions to test
- **Large-Scale Pilots**: Testing changes too broadly, reducing learning opportunity
- **Study Phase Skip**: Moving to action without comparing prediction to results  
- **Learning Loss**: Failing to capture and share knowledge from cycles

## First 3 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Establish Theory-Based Planning
- Train teams on difference between PDSA (study prediction vs actual) and PDCA (check implementation)
- Create hypothesis template requiring clear theory and specific predictions
- Define small-scale test parameters (time, scope, participants)
- Set up measurement systems to capture both process and outcome data

### Step 2: Implement Study Phase Analytics
- Build comparison framework for predicted vs actual results  
- Configure statistical analysis tools (control charts, effect size calculations)
- Create learning capture templates documenting insights and theory updates
- Establish review process for validating or revising underlying theories

### Step 3: Deploy Decision Gates and Knowledge Management
- Design Act phase workflow with adopt/abandon/iterate decision criteria
- Create standardization process for successful improvements
- Build learning repository linking related cycles and cumulative knowledge
- Schedule regular reviews of organizational learning and theory development
