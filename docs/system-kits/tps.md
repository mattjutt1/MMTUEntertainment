# Toyota Production System (TPS) Implementation Checklist

## Purpose
Produce exactly what's needed, when needed, with built-in quality to minimize waste and lead time through Just-in-Time flow and Jidoka (automation with human touch).

## Inputs
- Customer demand signals and takt time
- Process flow maps and cycle times  
- Quality standards and abnormality definitions
- Supplier delivery schedules
- Operator skills and training status

## Outputs
- Products delivered according to customer pull
- Andon alerts for abnormalities and quality issues
- Standardized work procedures with kaizen improvements
- Leveled production schedule (heijunka)
- Continuous flow with minimal inventory buffers

## Automation Primitives
1. **Pull Signal Orchestration**: Digital kanban triggering replenishment by consumption
2. **Jidoka Alarms**: Automated abnormality detection with line stop authority
3. **Takt/Capacity Balancing**: Real-time takt computation and heijunka scheduling  
4. **Standard Work Instructions**: Versioned SOPs with adherence tracking
5. **Kaizen Feedback Loop**: Improvement idea capture with PDCA tracking

## Implementation Risks
- **JIT Without Jidoka**: Fast flow of defects without quality gates
- **Andon Resistance**: Workers afraid to stop line due to productivity pressure
- **Supplier Integration Gaps**: External suppliers not synchronized to pull signals
- **Takt Time Volatility**: Demand fluctuations overwhelming capacity flexibility
- **Kaizen Theatre**: Improvement suggestions without systematic implementation

## First 3 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Map Value Stream and Calculate Takt Time
- Document current state value stream with all process steps
- Calculate takt time = Available Work Time / Customer Demand Rate  
- Identify bottlenecks, waste, and flow interruptions
- Design future state with continuous flow and pull systems

### Step 2: Implement Jidoka (Quality at Source)
- Define abnormalities and quality standards for each process step
- Install andon system with visual alerts and escalation procedures
- Train operators on stop-the-line authority and problem-solving
- Create standardized work with built-in quality checks

### Step 3: Establish Pull System with Kanban
- Design kanban card system linking customer consumption to production
- Set up supplier integration for just-in-time material delivery
- Implement heijunka (production leveling) to smooth demand variation
- Begin kaizen culture with daily improvement huddles and PDCA tracking
