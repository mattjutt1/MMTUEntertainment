# MMTU Docs (Diátaxis Spine)
We structure docs by user need using Diátaxis:
- Tutorials – learning-oriented, step-by-step
- How‑to guides – goal-oriented tasks with prerequisites
- Reference – factual API/CLI/configuration
- Explanation – concepts, design, trade-offs

## Layout
- `docs/tutorials/`
- `docs/how-to/`
- `docs/reference/`
- `docs/explanation/`
- `docs/templates/` (PPP, issue/PR snippets)

See `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to choose the right type and write effectively.
