# Mixed-Change Verification (Post-Fix)

**Date**: Fri Aug 22 06:27:00 UTC 2025
**Purpose**: Verify that mixed changes (site + docs) trigger full E2E tests post-logic-fix

**Expected Behavior**: 
- Filter outputs: `site: true`, `docs_only: true`
- Workflow execution: Full E2E smoke tests (â‰¤3min runtime)
- Steps executed: Checkout, Setup PNPM, Install deps, Build site, Run tests, Upload artifacts
- Result: SUCCESS with proper E2E execution (not noop)

This verifies the fix for the critical logic bug where the condition:
`site_changed == 'true' && docs_only != 'true'`

Was incorrectly evaluating to false for mixed changes, causing E2E tests to be skipped.

The corrected condition `site_changed == 'true'` should now properly trigger E2E tests.
