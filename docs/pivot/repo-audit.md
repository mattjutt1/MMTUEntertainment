## Repository Health Metrics

### Strengths
- ✅ Clear application separation
- ✅ Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- ✅ Production deployment pipeline
- ✅ Revenue-focused documentation

### Issues
- ❌ Scattered documentation structure
- ❌ Test artifact accumulation (176 files)
- ❌ Redundant tooling across apps
- ❌ Mixed development/production files

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Archive non-revenue apps** below conversion thresholds
2. **Consolidate documentation** into /docs/pivot/ structure
3. **Clean test artifacts** older than 30 days
4. **Merge redundant utilities** into core revenue products

### Structural Improvements
1. **Create /data/{raw,processed}/** for analytics data
2. **Move deployment scripts** to /pivot-checks/
3. **Standardize app structure** across revenue products
4. **Implement automated cleanup** for test artifacts

## Impact Assessment Preview

- **Storage reduction**: ~40% (test artifacts + archives)
- **Maintenance overhead**: -60% (fewer independent apps)
- **Revenue focus**: +80% (eliminate low-conversion products)
