## Loom Video Script (3-4 minutes)

### Hook (0-15 seconds)
*"Hi [Name], I noticed your team at [Company] has been growing fast on GitHub. I wanted to show you how teams like yours are protecting their PRs without the complexity and cost of traditional static analysis platforms."*

### Problem Identification (15-45 seconds)
*"Most engineering teams face the same challenge: they need PR security, but tools like SonarCloud or Veracode are expensive per-developer and take weeks to set up. Plus, when your team grows, your security bill grows with it."*

### Solution Demo (45-2:30)
*"That's why we built DriftGuard. Let me show you how it works..."*

**[Screen Recording]**
1. **GitHub Marketplace install** (30 seconds)
   - "Here's our GitHub Marketplace listing..."
   - "One-click install to your organization..."
   - "Select repositories to protect..."

2. **Policy configuration** (45 seconds)
   - "Choose from pre-built security policy packs..."
   - "Or create custom policies for your specific needs..."
   - "Everything is configured through this simple interface..."

3. **PR protection in action** (45 seconds)
   - "When a developer opens a PR..."
   - "DriftGuard automatically checks it against your policies..."
   - "If there are violations, the PR is blocked with clear guidance..."
   - "Clean PRs get an automatic green check..."

### Value Proposition (2:30-3:15)
*"The key difference: DriftGuard focuses specifically on PR protection rather than comprehensive code analysis. You get security where it matters most - at merge time - without the platform complexity or per-developer pricing that makes other tools expensive as you scale."*

### Social Proof (3:15-3:30)
*"Teams using DriftGuard typically save 40-60% compared to per-developer tools, and they're protecting PRs within 5 minutes of installation."*

### Call to Action (3:30-4:00)
*"I'd love to set up a 15-minute demo to show you how DriftGuard would work with your specific repositories and security requirements. You can also start a free 14-day trial right from our marketplace listing - no credit card required."*

*"I'll send a follow-up email with links to get started. Thanks for your time, [Name]!"*

## Cold Email Sequence

### Email 1: Problem-Focused Introduction
**Subject**: Quick question about your GitHub security setup

Hi [Name],

I was looking at [Company]'s GitHub activity and noticed you have [X] developers working across [Y] repositories. 

Quick question: How are you currently handling security checks for pull requests? 

Most teams your size are dealing with one of two challenges:
1. **No systematic PR security** (relying on manual code review)
2. **Expensive per-developer tools** that get costly as the team grows

We built DriftGuard specifically for teams who want PR security without the platform tax of traditional static analysis tools.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

Best,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** - Here's a 3-minute demo showing how teams protect PRs in under 5 minutes: [Loom link]

### Email 2: Social Proof + Value (3 days later)
**Subject**: How [Similar Company] saved $2,400/month on GitHub security

Hi [Name],

Following up on my previous email about GitHub PR security.

I wanted to share a quick story: [Similar Company] (also [industry] with ~[team size] developers) was spending $3,200/month on per-developer security tools.

They switched to DriftGuard and now pay $299/month for the same PR protection. **That's $2,400/month in savings** they're reinvesting in product development.

The key insight: they realized they didn't need comprehensive static analysis - just effective merge protection.

**Two ways to explore this:**
1. **Free trial**: Install from GitHub Marketplace (14 days, no credit card)
2. **Quick demo**: 15-minute walkthrough of your specific repos

Which makes more sense for your timeline?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email 3: Competitive Positioning (7 days later)
**Subject**: DriftGuard vs. SonarCloud - honest comparison

Hi [Name],

Since I haven't heard back, I figured you might be evaluating different options for GitHub security.

I put together an honest comparison of DriftGuard vs. the alternatives (SonarCloud, DeepSource, etc.):

**DriftGuard is better if you:**
- Want predictable org-based pricing
- Need fast setup without CI/CD changes  
- Focus on PR protection over comprehensive analysis
- Prefer native GitHub integration

**SonarCloud is better if you:**
- Need deep static analysis beyond security
- Have complex compliance requirements
- Want detailed code quality metrics
- Have dedicated DevOps resources for setup

Here's the detailed comparison: [Link to comparison page]

**Bottom line**: If you want simple, effective PR security without platform complexity, DriftGuard is designed for teams exactly like yours.

Still worth that 15-minute demo?

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email 4: Scarcity + Final Value (14 days later)
**Subject**: Last email - DriftGuard trial ending soon

Hi [Name],

This will be my last email about DriftGuard.

I noticed a few things about [Company] that suggest you'd get significant value from our PR security approach:

1. **Team size** ([X] developers) hits the sweet spot where per-developer pricing becomes expensive
2. **Repository activity** ([Y] PRs/month) shows you need systematic security, not just manual review
3. **Tech stack** ([language/framework]) aligns with our strongest policy coverage

**Here's what I can offer:**
- **Free 14-day trial** with full Team features (normally $299/month)
- **15-minute demo** tailored to your specific repositories
- **Custom policy pack** for your industry/compliance needs

If GitHub PR security isn't a priority right now, no worries - I understand. But if it is, we're probably the simplest path forward.

Interested in that demo?

Best,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** - If not, I'd appreciate 30 seconds of feedback on why DriftGuard wasn't a fit. Helps us improve for other teams like yours.
