# Working Notes – MMTU Entertainment

Purpose:
This file exists so Matt and I can capture ideas before they get blurred, swapped, or lost.
Nothing here needs to be polished. Raw thoughts are valid.

- First decision: start with "idea capture" as System 0.
- Rule: banter → artifact. If an idea shows up, pin it here.
- This file is the vault. Amy can't erase it once written.
## Triage Phase - 2025-08-19
- Repo inventory completed - see .triage_*.txt files
- Three-doc structure: working-notes (ideas) + pivot-rules (constraints) + repo-map (structure)
- No deletes yet - documentation first, action later
- Success criteria: clear view of what we have vs what we need
