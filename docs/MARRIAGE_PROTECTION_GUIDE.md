# Marriage Protection Mode - Complete Guide

## Purpose

Marriage Protection Mode is a comprehensive work-life balance enforcement system designed to prevent work addiction and protect personal relationships through technical guardrails and transparency mechanisms.

### Core Objectives:
- **Prevent overwork health risks**: Technical enforcement of 8-hour daily limits
- **Enhance marriage quality**: Mandatory 2-hour check-ins and spouse oversight
- **Maintain transparency**: Complete audit trail of all work activities
- **Provide emergency controls**: Spouse can halt work immediately when needed

## Consent & Privacy Statement

**This system is implemented with full informed consent and designed to protect privacy while maintaining relationship transparency.**

### What We Monitor:
✅ **Work time duration** - Total hours spent in active work sessions  
✅ **Activity detection** - File modification timestamps to detect idle periods  
✅ **Check-in compliance** - Whether 2-hour spouse interaction occurred  
✅ **Approval code usage** - When overtime was authorized and by whom  

### What We DON'T Monitor:
❌ **No keystroke logging** - We never record what you type  
❌ **No screen capture** - No visual monitoring of work content  
❌ **No network surveillance** - No tracking of websites or communications  
❌ **No personal data collection** - Only coarse time/status information  

### Data Storage:
- All data stored locally in plain-text files
- No cloud uploads or external transmission
- Complete data ownership and control retained
- Can be disabled or deleted at any time

## Scientific Foundation

This system is grounded in peer-reviewed research on work-life balance and behavioral interventions:

### Health Risks of Long Work Hours
**WHO/ILO Global Analysis**: Working 55+ hours per week increases stroke risk by 35% and heart disease death risk by 17%. The analysis found approximately 745,000 deaths annually attributable to overwork ([WHO Press Release, 2021](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-05-2021-long-working-hours-increasing-deaths-from-heart-disease-and-stroke-ilo-who)).

**Key Finding**: *"Working 55 or more hours per week is associated with an estimated 35% higher risk of a stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from ischemic heart disease, compared to working 35-40 hours a week."*

### Effectiveness of Micro-Breaks
**Meta-Analysis of Workplace Breaks** (Albulescu et al., 2022): Systematic review of 22 studies found that short, frequent breaks significantly improve well-being, reduce fatigue, and enhance performance. Two-hour intervals align with optimal break frequency research ([PMC Article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5316505/)).

**Key Finding**: *"Short breaks taken during the workday had significant positive effects on well-being, with stronger effects observed for breaks that were self-initiated rather than imposed."*

### Commitment Devices for Behavior Change
**Behavioral Economics Research** (DellaVigna & Malmendier, 2006): "Commitment devices" - mechanisms that restrict future choices - are effective tools for achieving personal goals. Approval codes function as commitment devices by requiring deliberate action to override limits ([Berkeley Economics Working Paper](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~sdellavi/wp/gymempAER.pdf)).

**Key Finding**: *"Individuals who choose restrictive contracts demonstrate awareness of their self-control problems and benefit from external enforcement mechanisms."*

## How Approval Codes Work

The approval code system implements a "commitment device" - a behavioral tool that helps align actions with stated intentions.

### Mechanism:
1. **Default State**: 8-hour work limit automatically enforced
2. **Override Requirement**: Spouse must consciously approve overtime
3. **Active Decision**: Creates deliberate friction before overwork
4. **Transparency**: All approvals logged with timestamp and reason

### Behavioral Benefits:
- **Reduces impulsive overwork**: Introduces cooling-off period
- **Increases spousal involvement**: Makes work limits a shared decision
- **Creates accountability**: Clear audit trail of exceptions
- **Preserves autonomy**: Spouse controls approval, not external system

### Privacy Protection:
- Approval codes are simple 4-8 character strings
- Never logged in plain text after initial setting
- Stored locally with 600 permissions (owner-only access)
- Automatically expire daily (no persistent authorization)

## System Architecture

### Core Components:

**1. Background Daemon** (`marriage_protection.sh start`)
- Monitors work activity every 60 seconds
- Tracks accumulated work time per day
- Detects idle periods (no file changes >15 minutes)
- Enforces 8-hour daily limits automatically
- Sends 2-hour check-in reminders

**2. Wife Dashboard** (`wife_dashboard.sh`)
- Secure access via passcode authentication
- Real-time work time monitoring
- Approval code management (set/revoke)
- Emergency halt capabilities
- Weekly work pattern analysis

**3. Integration Layer**
- Automatic integration with Front Desk triage system
- Links work sessions to active task IDs (T-XXXX)
- Generates daily and weekly reports
- Maintains complete JSONL audit trail

### File Structure:
```
.ops/
├── session/YYYY-MM-DD.state       # Daily work time tracking
├── approvals/YYYY-MM-DD.code      # Daily approval codes (600 perms)
├── marriage_protection.pid         # Daemon process ID
└── wife.secret                     # Dashboard access code (600 perms)

reports/
├── daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md            # Daily work summaries
└── weekly/YYYY-WW.md              # Weekly aggregated reports

front-desk/
└── log.jsonl                       # Integrated audit trail
```

## Daily Operations

### Starting Work Session:
```bash
./scripts/marriage_protection.sh start
```
- Starts background monitoring daemon
- Begins tracking work time for current day
- Automatically detects activity vs. idle periods

### Checking Status:
```bash
./scripts/marriage_protection.sh status
```
- Shows current work time (hours:minutes)
- Displays next check-in reminder time
- Indicates approval code status
- Reports daemon health

### Wife Dashboard Access:
```bash
./scripts/wife_dashboard.sh setup    # First-time setup
./scripts/wife_dashboard.sh today    # View today's summary
./scripts/wife_dashboard.sh week     # View weekly patterns
```

### Setting Approval Codes (Wife Only):
```bash
./scripts/wife_dashboard.sh set-code 1234
```
- Enables work beyond 8-hour limit
- Requires secure dashboard access
- Automatically expires at midnight
- Logged for transparency

### Emergency Halt (Wife Only):
```bash
./scripts/wife_dashboard.sh halt
```
- Immediately stops all work monitoring
- Forces work session termination
- Cannot be overridden by worker
- Logged as emergency event

## 2-Hour Check-In System

### Purpose:
Regular marriage check-ins prevent work tunnel vision and maintain relationship connection during work sessions.

### Implementation:
- Automatic reminders every 2 hours of active work
- Written to daily report files for visibility
- Not enforced technically (trust-based)
- Logged for accountability

### Recommended Check-In Actions:
1. **Physical presence**: Go to spouse's location
2. **Status update**: Briefly explain current work focus
3. **Emotional connection**: Hug, kiss, or other affection
4. **Permission check**: Ask if continued work is acceptable
5. **End time commitment**: State planned work completion time

## How to Disable

### Temporary Pause:
```bash
./scripts/marriage_protection.sh stop
```

### Complete Removal:
1. Stop daemon: `./scripts/marriage_protection.sh stop`
2. Remove files: `rm -rf .ops/`
3. Remove reports: `rm -rf reports/daily/`
4. Remove dashboard: `./scripts/wife_dashboard.sh` → delete wife.secret

### Data Export (Before Removal):
```bash
# Export all work time data
grep "marriage_protection" front-desk/log.jsonl > marriage_protection_backup.jsonl

# Export weekly summaries
cp -r reports/weekly/ marriage_protection_reports_backup/
```

## Reading Logs

### JSONL Format:
Each line in `front-desk/log.jsonl` is a separate JSON object with these fields:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-22T15:30:00Z",    # UTC timestamp
  "module": "marriage_protection",        # System component
  "action": "daemon_started",            # Event type
  "seconds_today": 14400,                # Total work seconds today
  "task_ref": "T-0042",                  # Current task ID (if any)
  "data": {"initial_seconds": 0},        # Additional event data
  "source": "marriage_protection"        # Event source
}
```

### Key Event Types:
- `daemon_started` / `daemon_stopped` - Work session boundaries
- `activity_resumed` / `idle_detected` - Activity state changes
- `checkin_reminder` - 2-hour check-in notifications
- `overtime_blocked` / `overtime_approved` - 8-hour limit interactions
- `wife_set_approval_code` / `wife_revoked_approval` - Spouse actions
- `emergency_shutdown` - Emergency halt events

### Analysis Commands:
```bash
# Count total work events today
grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" front-desk/log.jsonl | wc -l

# Show all overtime approvals this week
grep "overtime_approved" front-desk/log.jsonl | grep "$(date +%Y-W%V)"

# List all emergency shutdowns
grep "emergency_shutdown" front-desk/log.jsonl
```

## Why 2-Hour Nudges and 8-Hour Caps

### 2-Hour Check-In Interval:
- **Attention restoration**: Prevents hyperfocus and tunnel vision
- **Relationship maintenance**: Regular connection prevents isolation
- **Health benefits**: Aligns with break frequency research recommendations
- **Conflict prevention**: Early intervention before spouse frustration builds

### 8-Hour Daily Limit:
- **WHO health standards**: Aligned with international workplace health recommendations
- **Sustainable productivity**: Prevents burnout that reduces long-term effectiveness
- **Marriage protection**: Preserves time for relationship maintenance
- **Cultural norm**: Standard full-time work duration expectation

### Technical Implementation Benefits:
- **Consistent enforcement**: Removes daily willpower/negotiation burden
- **Transparent limits**: Both parties know exactly what to expect
- **Flexibility with oversight**: Approval system allows exceptions with permission
- **Evidence-based**: All decisions backed by complete audit trail
