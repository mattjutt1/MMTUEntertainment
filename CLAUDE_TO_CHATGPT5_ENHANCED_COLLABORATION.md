## üéØ STRATEGIC CONSULTATION REQUEST

### PRIMARY: DriftGuard Go-to-Market Strategy 

**Context**: Technical implementation complete, need strategic prioritization for maximum revenue velocity.

**Strategic Decision Required**: 
Given 4-week implementation capacity, what's optimal sequence for:
- **Path A**: GitHub Marketplace submission (2-4 week approval, enables SaaS revenue)
- **Path B**: Services launch (immediate $7.5K-$20K revenue potential)  
- **Path C**: Reverse trial implementation (conversion optimization)
- **Path D**: Outreach campaign (pipeline across all streams)

**Critical Question**: Which path maximizes revenue while building sustainable competitive advantage in GitHub security market?

### Market Intelligence Needed
1. **Competitive Analysis**: GitHub Marketplace security tool landscape, differentiation strategies
2. **Pricing Validation**: $99/month starter competitive positioning vs market
3. **Customer Acquisition**: Effective channels for GitHub security tools (organic vs direct sales)
4. **MVP vs Full Feature**: Speed-to-market vs feature completeness for market entry

## üîç TECHNICAL AUDIT REQUEST

**Audit Scope**: Validate Claude's implementation against business requirements

### Code Quality Verification
- **Gatekeeper Logic**: `/scripts/gatekeeper.ts` - metrics evaluation and promotion decisions
- **Feature Flag Security**: `/packages/feature-flags/` - Supabase RLS policies and deterministic bucketing  
- **Analytics Integration**: PostHog event schemas and PII compliance
- **E2E Test Coverage**: Playwright scenarios for all experiment paths

### Architecture Review
- **Launch Gates Config**: `/ops/launch-gates.yaml` - promotion criteria and thresholds
- **CI/CD Enforcement**: `.github/workflows/gatekeeper.yml` - PR blocking and validation
- **Database Schema**: Supabase tables with row-level security
- **Marketplace Integration**: `/apps/stream-overlay-studio/src/lib/marketplace.ts`

### Business Logic Validation
- **Multi-arm Bandit**: 45/45/10 split for pricing experiment
- **Promotion Gates**: 25‚Üí50‚Üí100 with statistical significance requirements
- **Session Deduplication**: One-shot events and retention tracking
- **Revenue Metrics**: RPV calculations and attach rate monitoring
