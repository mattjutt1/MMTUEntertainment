## CORE CHALLENGE DECOMPOSITION

### Primary Problem Analysis
The user presented a meta-cognitive challenge: **inability to establish objective "beginning" moments** leading to infinite preparation loops. This manifested as:

1. **"Beginning" Problem**: Never feeling at the absolute starting point → endless stalling
2. **"Spiral" Problem**: Systems becoming meta-systems for optimization → infinite improvement loops

### Constraint Framework Applied
| Constraint | Purpose | Implementation | Verification |
|------------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **$0 Budget** | Eliminate tool-shopping paralysis | Plain text files only | `ls -la` shows no external dependencies |
| **Objective Beginning** | Create falsifiable start point | START.yml with UTC timestamp | Git history proves commit time |
| **Minimal Surface** | Prevent overwhelm/analysis | 5 files maximum | Complete system in 5 files |
| **Timer > Feelings** | Force action over perfection | 20-minute hard stops | Timer enforces session boundaries |
| **Evidence > Intentions** | Measure progress objectively | log.jsonl with timestamps | Quantifiable entry counts |

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Core Components Matrix

<system_specification>
**File Structure:**
```
├── START.yml                    # Irreversible beginning marker (UTC timestamp)
├── front-desk/
│   ├── intake.md                # Raw capture (brain dump)
│   ├── triage.md               # Processed actions with due dates  
│   └── log.jsonl               # Append-only evidence trail
├── reports/
│   └── week-01.md              # Auto-generated metrics
└── scripts/
    ├── triage.py               # Auto-processing (heuristic-based)
    ├── triage_interactive.py   # Manual processing (user prompts)
    ├── daily_loop.sh          # 20-minute routine automation
    ├── doubt_reset.sh          # Emergency spiral-breaker
    ├── enforce_rules.sh        # Compliance monitoring
    └── quickstart_30min.sh     # Initial setup automation
```

**Total System Complexity:** 9 files, 5 core workflows
**Dependencies:** bash, python3, text editor (all built-in)
**External Services:** None (completely offline-capable)
</system_specification>

### Workflow Engine Design

#### 1. Initial Bootstrap (30-minute quickstart)
- **Input**: Empty directory + timer
- **Process**: Automated file creation, example data population
- **Output**: Working system with evidence trail started
- **Verification**: START.yml exists with commit timestamp

#### 2. Daily Operations (20-minute loop)
- **Capture Phase**: Raw items → intake.md
- **Process Phase**: Items → actionable triage entries  
- **Evidence Phase**: Activities → log.jsonl entries
- **Reporting Phase**: Counts → week-01.md metrics

#### 3. Anti-Spiral Mechanisms
- **Doubt Protocol**: 60-second reset routine
- **Rule Enforcement**: 5 constraints with violation tracking
- **Timer Constraints**: External session boundaries
- **Redesign Freeze**: No improvements until Day 14

</code_metrics>

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Input (Raw Ideas)
     ↓
intake.md (Plain Text)
     ↓
Triage Process (Manual/Auto)
     ↓
triage.md (Structured Actions) + log.jsonl (Evidence)
     ↓
Report Generation
     ↓
week-01.md (Metrics Dashboard)
```

**Data Persistence Strategy:**
- **Append-only log**: Prevents data loss, enables audit trail
- **Plain text format**: Human readable, version controllable  
- **Local storage**: No external dependencies, offline-capable
- **Timestamp integrity**: UTC consistency across all entries

## PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTION MECHANISMS

### Anti-Pattern Prevention Matrix

| Mental Trap | Technical Solution | Enforcement Method | Measurable Outcome |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Analysis Paralysis | 70% decision rule | Force action with partial info | Unknowns → intake.md entries |
| Perfectionism | 20-minute timer | Hard session stops | Session logs with durations |
| Tool Shopping | $0 budget constraint | No external dependencies | Zero cost verification |
| "Not Started" Feeling | START.yml timestamp | Objective beginning proof | Git commit evidence |
| Feature Creep | 5-file limit + Day 14 freeze | File count enforcement | System complexity metrics |
| Procrastination | Doubt protocol | 60-second reset routine | Doubt clearance log entries |

### Behavioral Modification Strategies

<behavioral_specification>
**Trigger-Response Automation:**
1. **Doubt Event** → Open START.yml → Read timestamp → Add line to intake → Resume work
2. **Timer End** → Force stop → Log session → Schedule next session  
3. **Rule Violation** → Log penalty → Apply constraint → Continue work
4. **Empty Intake** → Add 3 items minimum → Process immediately
5. **Day 14 Gate** → Count verification → Pass/fail determination

**Habit Formation Mechanisms:**
- 20-minute daily sessions (sustainable duration)
- Consistent file locations (muscle memory)
- Mechanical processes (reduce decision fatigue)
- Visible progress (count metrics)
- Evidence accumulation (motivation reinforcement)
</behavioral_specification>

- **Trade-offs**: Slight storage overhead vs perfect historical record

#### 2. State Machine Design  
- **States**: Raw → Triaged → Completed
- **Transitions**: Explicit actions with logged evidence
- **Benefits**: Clear progress tracking, no ambiguous states

#### 3. Constraint-Driven Development
- **Approach**: Technical limits as behavioral modification
- **Implementation**: $0 budget, file limits, timer boundaries
- **Psychology**: Remove choice paralysis through imposed limitations

#### 4. Fail-Safe Mechanisms
- **Multiple Modes**: Auto triage + manual triage + pure manual
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works without Python, without scripts

2. **Python Unavailable**: Mitigated by manual mode documentation
3. **Disk Space**: Minimal (text files), self-limiting by design
4. **Timestamp Drift**: UTC normalization, external time sources

**Behavioral Risks:**  
1. **Abandonment**: Mitigated by 20-minute sessions (sustainable)
2. **Rule Violation**: Automated detection and penalty system
3. **Analysis Paralysis**: Hard-coded doubt protocol
4. **Feature Creep**: Day 14 redesign freeze enforced

**Operational Risks:**
