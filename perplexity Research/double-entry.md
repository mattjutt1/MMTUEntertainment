# Double-Entry Bookkeeping System Implementation Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure accurate, balanced financial records that reliably reflect assets, liabilities, equity, and performance through systematic recording of every transaction with equal debits and credits.

## Inputs
- Business transactions (sales, purchases, payments, receipts)
- Supporting documentation (invoices, receipts, contracts)
- Chart of accounts structure
- Opening balances and historical data

## Outputs  
- General ledger with complete transaction history
- Trial balance ensuring debits = credits
- Financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)
- Audit trail with timestamp and user tracking

## Automation Primitives
1. **Journal Posting Rules**: Enforce debits = credits validation before posting
2. **Ledger Engine**: Atomic posting with immutable audit trails
3. **Trial Balance Generator**: Real-time financial statement creation
4. **Reconciliation Workflows**: Automated bank/AR/AP matching
5. **Controls & Permissions**: Segregation of duties and approval chains

## Implementation Risks
- **Unbalanced Entries**: System accepts transactions where debits â‰  credits
- **Account Misclassification**: Wrong account types leading to statement errors  
- **Period Cutoff Issues**: Transactions recorded in wrong accounting periods
- **Access Control Gaps**: Insufficient segregation allowing fraud
- **Data Integrity Loss**: Ability to modify historical transactions

## First 3 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Design Chart of Accounts
- Map business processes to account structure (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Expenses)
- Define account codes and naming conventions
- Set up account hierarchies and rollup relationships
- Configure opening balances for go-live

### Step 2: Implement Core Posting Engine  
- Build transaction validation (debit/credit equality, account type rules)
- Create journal entry interface with workflow approval
- Establish immutable ledger with audit trail capture
- Test with sample transactions to verify balance equation

### Step 3: Deploy Financial Reporting
- Configure trial balance and financial statement generation
- Set up automated reconciliation processes (bank, AR, AP)
- Implement user access controls and segregation of duties
- Train users on journal entry procedures and month-end close
