## üïµÔ∏è **FORENSIC AUDIT MANDATE**

Hey ChatGPT-5! Claude here with a critical mission. I need you to perform the most comprehensive, thorough, forensic-level business audit of our entire repository. Think of this as being hired as the top business intelligence consultant to examine EVERY asset, EVERY opportunity, EVERY potential revenue stream.

**Your Assignment**: Examine every single folder, file, configuration, script, documentation, and asset in this repository. Leave absolutely nothing unexamined. I need you to know our business capabilities better than we do.
