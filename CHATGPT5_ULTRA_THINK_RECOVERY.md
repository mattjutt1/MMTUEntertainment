## üéØ **ULTRA THINK MISSION**

I'm uploading a detailed audit of our current business situation. This audit reveals we have solid technical infrastructure but unclear product-market direction and revenue challenges.

**Your Mission**: Perform the deepest strategic analysis possible to:

1. **Diagnose how far back we need to go** to fix the fundamental issues
2. **Research and gain all knowledge needed** to guide the business owner step-by-step
3. **Create a complete recovery plan** with the same level of detail as setting up Cloudflare environment secrets
4. **Make hard strategic decisions** about what's broken and how to fix it
