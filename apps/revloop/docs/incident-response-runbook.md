# Revenue Loop Incident Response Runbook

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: August 2025  
**Owner**: Revenue Operations Team

## Overview

This runbook provides step-by-step procedures for responding to Digital Andon alerts in the Revenue Loop monitoring system. Based on Toyota Production System (TPS) Jidoka principles for immediate problem detection and response.

## Incident Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

#### For P1 Critical Alerts

1. **Acknowledge Alert** ⏱️ *Target: 5 minutes*
   ```bash
   # Log into Revenue Loop dashboard
   # Click "Acknowledge" on the active alert
   # This stops alert escalation
   ```

2. **Assess Scope** ⏱️ *Target: 10 minutes*
   - Which funnel stage is affected?
   - What is the current drop-off rate vs. baseline?
   - How many users are impacted?
   - What's the estimated revenue impact?

3. **Initial Communication** ⏱️ *Target: 15 minutes*
   ```
   Subject: P1 Revenue Alert - [Stage] Critical Issue
   
   SUMMARY: [Stage] experiencing [X]% drop-off rate (baseline: [Y]%)
   IMPACT: ~$[Z] estimated revenue loss per hour
   STATUS: Investigation in progress
   ETA: Update in 30 minutes
   
   Revenue Impact Dashboard: [link]
   Incident Channel: #revenue-incidents
   ```

#### For P2 High Alerts

1. **Monitor Trend** ⏱️ *Target: 30 minutes*
   - Track if anomaly is increasing, stable, or decreasing
   - Check correlated stages for impact spreading

2. **Check Recent Changes**
   - Review deployments in last 24 hours
   - Check A/B test configurations
   - Verify pricing/promotion changes
   - Confirm payment processor status

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Reduce sample size for faster detection
   - Enable real-time alerting for related stages

   // Verify revenue impact calculations
   const revenueImpact = await validateRevenueTransaction([
     {
       accountCode: '6200', // Lost Revenue Expense
       accountType: AccountType.EXPENSE,
       amount: estimatedLoss,
       description: `Revenue loss - ${stage} anomaly`
     }
   ]);
   ```
