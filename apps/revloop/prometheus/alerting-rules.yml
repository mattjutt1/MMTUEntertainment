            This indicates a >3σ deviation from baseline requiring immediate intervention.
            
            **Immediate Actions Required:**
            • Acknowledge alert within 15 minutes (SLA)
            • Assess revenue impact and user experience
            • Begin root cause analysis
            • Notify revenue team and on-call engineer

            **Actions Required:**
            • Enhanced monitoring for 30 minutes
            • Review recent deployments and changes
            • Assess for escalation to P1 if conditions worsen

            Andon counters not scraped for 10+ minutes.
            
            **Possible Causes:**
            • RevLoop service down (METRICS_PORT not set)
            • Prometheus scrape target misconfigured
            • Network connectivity issues
            • Service restart without metrics enabled
            
            **Immediate Actions:**
            • Check RevLoop service health: http://localhost:3001/health
            • Verify METRICS_PORT environment variable set
            • Check Prometheus scrape targets status
            • Review service logs for startup errors

            ATTENTION events comprise >80% of total alerts in last hour.
            
            This may indicate:
            • SPC thresholds too sensitive (tune Z_ATTENTION/Z_STOP)
            • Western Electric rules triggering excessively 
            • Baseline statistical models need recalibration
            
            **Tuning Actions:**
            • Review threshold configuration (Z_ATTENTION, Z_STOP)
            • Consider disabling Western Electric rules (WE_RULES=false)
            • Analyze baseline calculation accuracy

          description: |
            Significant imbalance between Sigma and Western Electric rule triggers over 4 hours.
            
            This suggests one detection method is significantly more/less sensitive.
            Consider reviewing rule effectiveness and tuning parameters.
            
            **Analysis Actions:**
            • Compare rule effectiveness metrics
            • Review Western Electric rule configuration
            • Analyze statistical baseline accuracy
