# Reverse Trial Strategy - DriftGuard

## Core Concept
**"Start with power, stay for simplicity"** - 14-day Team tier trial → automatic downgrade to Free tier

## Implementation Strategy

### Trial Flow
1. **Signup**: New users get instant Team tier access (no credit card)
2. **Experience**: Full Team features for 14 days
   - 25 repositories
   - 2,000 PRs/month
   - SSO integration
   - Advanced analytics
   - Policy testing sandbox
3. **Downgrade**: Day 15 → automatic Free tier transition
4. **Upgrade Path**: Frictionless upgrade to paid Team tier

### Technical Implementation

#### User Journey
```
Day 0: Sign up → Team trial activated
Day 7: Email reminder "7 days left of Team features"
Day 12: Email "Last chance to keep Team features"
Day 15: Auto-downgrade to Free tier
Day 16: "Upgrade to restore Team features" prompt
```

#### Feature Gating Logic
```yaml
trial_user:
  status: "trial"
  trial_end: "2024-09-12T00:00:00Z"
  features: ["team_tier"]
  
post_trial_user:
  status: "free"
  features: ["free_tier"]
  previous_trial: true
  upgrade_incentive: "team_features_experienced"
```

### Psychological Framework

#### Why Reverse Trials Work
- **Loss Aversion**: Users don't want to lose access they've experienced
- **Feature Anchoring**: Advanced features become the baseline expectation
- **Reduced Friction**: No credit card removes signup barriers
- **Trust Building**: Shows confidence in product value

#### Key Messaging
- **Trial**: "Experience our full Team features for 14 days"
- **Reminder**: "Keep the advanced features you're using"
- **Downgrade**: "Your account has been moved to our Free tier"
- **Upgrade**: "Restore the Team features you were using"
