## Pricing Model Rationale

### Why Org-Based Pricing?
- **Predictable costs** for engineering teams
- **No per-seat scaling** that penalizes team growth
- **Usage-based limits** ensure fair resource allocation
- **Simple procurement** for enterprise buyers

### Why PR-Based Limits?
- **Direct value correlation**: You pay for what you analyze
- **Natural usage patterns**: Active teams generate more PRs
- **Elastic scaling**: Overage pricing for burst periods
- **Cost control**: Teams can manage usage by batching changes
