## Strategic Implementation Questions

### 1. Go-to-Market Prioritization
I've executed all 6 business development prompts. Which should we implement first for fastest revenue impact?

**Options:**
- A) GitHub Marketplace submission (get DriftGuard live)
- B) Services launch (immediate $7.5K-20K deals)
- C) Reverse trial implementation (drive SaaS conversions)
- D) Outreach campaign execution (fill pipeline)

**My technical perspective**: Marketplace submission has longest approval cycle (2-4 weeks), so should start immediately. But services can generate revenue this month.

### 2. MVP vs. Full Feature Scope
For DriftGuard marketplace launch, what's the minimum viable feature set?

**Current technical capabilities I can build:**
- GitHub App with PR status checks ✅
- Basic security policy engine ✅
- Simple dashboard for violation reporting ✅
- Stripe subscription integration ✅

**Advanced features requiring more time:**
- SSO integration (2-3 weeks)
- Advanced analytics dashboard (3-4 weeks)
- Custom policy visual editor (4-6 weeks)
- Slack/Teams integrations (1-2 weeks)

Should we launch with basic features and iterate, or build more before marketplace submission?

### 3. Services vs. SaaS Revenue Balance
The SOW templates look strong, but I want to avoid "consulting trap" where services cannibalize SaaS growth.

**Question**: What's the optimal services-to-SaaS ratio? Should we:
- Cap services at 20% of revenue (stay SaaS-focused)?
- Use services purely as SaaS lead generation?
- Price services to naturally drive SaaS upgrades?

### 4. Competitive Intelligence Gaps
I need your market research depth on these specific questions:

**GitHub Security Market:**
- How crowded is the GitHub App marketplace for security tools?
- What are the actual conversion rates from marketplace listing to paid customer?
- Are there recent GitHub policy changes that create opportunities?

**Pricing Validation:**
- Is $99/month starter tier competitive or too aggressive?
- How do similar tools handle overage pricing?
- What's the typical LTV:CAC ratio for GitHub security tools?

### 5. Technical Architecture Decisions
I need business input on these technical choices:

**Multi-tenancy approach:**
- Single database with org isolation (faster to build)
- Separate databases per enterprise customer (better security story)

**Policy engine:**
- YAML-based configuration (developer-friendly)
- Visual policy builder (less technical users)
- Both (more complex but broader appeal)

**Deployment model:**
- SaaS-only (simpler, faster scaling)
- SaaS + on-premise option (enterprise appeal, more complex)

### 6. Customer Acquisition Strategy
The outreach pack targets engineering leaders, but should we also consider:

**Alternative channels:**
- Developer advocates/community building?
- Content marketing (security blog, tutorials)?
- Partnership with GitHub (official partner program)?
- Conference/event presence?

**Customer success motion:**
- Self-serve onboarding vs. white-glove implementation?
- Proactive customer success vs. reactive support?

### 7. Funding/Investment Strategy
Current bootstrapped approach vs. raising capital:

**Bootstrap pros**: Full control, profitable from day 1, lean execution
**Funding pros**: Faster market capture, competitive moat, team scaling

Given the GitHub security market dynamics, do we need capital to compete effectively, or is bootstrap sufficient for our positioning?

### 8. Legal/Compliance Considerations
For enterprise customers, what compliance certifications are table stakes?

**Security requirements I can handle:**
- SOC 2 Type II preparation ✅
- Data encryption and security practices ✅
- Privacy policy and terms of service ✅

**Enterprise requirements I need guidance on:**
- GDPR/CCPA compliance complexity
- Industry-specific certifications (HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP)
- Enterprise contract terms and liability

### 9. Team Scaling Timeline
When do we need to add team members, and in what order?

**My assessment**:
- **Now**: I can handle all technical development
- **Month 3**: Need customer success/support person
- **Month 6**: Need dedicated sales person
- **Month 9**: Need additional developer

Does this align with revenue projections and market opportunity?

### 10. Success Metrics Definition
What are the key metrics we should track for each revenue stream?

**SaaS metrics I'll implement:**
- MRR/ARR growth
- Trial-to-paid conversion
- Customer churn rate
- Usage/engagement metrics

**Services metrics:**
- Pipeline value
- Win rate
- Project margin
- Upsell to SaaS rate

**Overall business health:**
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Gross margin by revenue stream

Are there other metrics critical for this specific market?

## Implementation Dependencies

### Questions requiring answers before I proceed:

1. **Priority order** for implementation (affects my next 4 weeks of work)
2. **MVP feature scope** (affects marketplace submission timeline)
3. **Technical architecture decisions** (affects development approach)

### Questions that can be answered in parallel:
- Market research validation
- Competitive intelligence
- Long-term strategy decisions

**My recommendation**: Start with marketplace submission (longest lead time) while you research market dynamics and validate pricing assumptions.
