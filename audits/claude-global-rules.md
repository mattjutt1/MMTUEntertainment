# Claude Global Rules: ChatGPT-5 Collaboration Framework

## PERMANENT GLOBAL RULE FOR CLAUDE CODE

This rule is now **PERMANENTLY ACTIVE** for all future MMTU Entertainment project interactions and must be followed without exception.

---

## MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**BEFORE PROCESSING ANY CHATGPT-5 REQUEST OR TASK**, Claude must:

### Step 1: Document Verification Protocol
1. **AUTOMATICALLY ACCESS** these three critical documents:
   - `audits/reports/tools-audit.md` - Complete CLI tools inventory (45+ tools)
   - `audits/reports/sub-agents-audit.md` - Specialized AI agents catalog (20+ agents)
   - `audits/reports/mcp-servers-audit.md` - MCP servers capabilities (15+ servers)

2. **VERIFY CHATGPT-5's RECOMMENDATIONS** against actual capabilities:
   - ‚úì Do recommended CLI tools exist and have correct versions?
   - ‚úì Are suggested sub-agents available with specified capabilities?
   - ‚úì Are MCP servers operational with described functionality?
   - ‚úì Are integration patterns technically feasible?

### Step 2: Resource Validation & Optimization
3. **VALIDATE TOOL AVAILABILITY**:
   ```bash
   # Example validation commands
   which git gh node npm pnpm playwright docker vercel wrangler
   npm list -g | grep -E "(playwright|typescript|eslint)"
   claude mcp list  # Verify MCP server status
   ```

4. **ASSESS TASK COMPLEXITY** and confirm resource allocation:
   - Simple tasks: Direct tool usage
   - Moderate tasks: Sub-agent coordination recommended
   - Complex tasks: Multi-agent orchestration required

5. **VERIFY MCP SERVER STATUS**:
   - Check server connectivity and responsiveness
   - Confirm tool exposure and functionality
   - Apply fallback strategies if servers unavailable

### Step 3: Intelligent Integration
6. **OPTIMIZE CHATGPT-5'S RECOMMENDATIONS**:
   - Adjust tool commands based on actual environment
   - Select most appropriate sub-agents for task context
   - Activate optimal MCP server combinations
   - Apply performance optimizations and caching strategies

7. **IMPLEMENT QUALITY GATES**:
   - Execute all 8 validation steps as recommended
   - Apply security scanning with available tools
   - Ensure performance thresholds are met
   - Validate integration points and dependencies

## COLLABORATION RESPONSE PROTOCOL

### When ChatGPT-5 Provides Task Guidance:

**Claude's Response Structure**:
```markdown
## ‚úÖ ChatGPT-5 Guidance Verified & Optimized

**Document Audit Results**:
- Tools verified: ‚úì [Confirmed available tools]
- Sub-agents confirmed: ‚úì [Available agents]
- MCP servers active: ‚úì [Operational servers]

**Optimized Execution Plan**:
[Implement ChatGPT-5's recommendations with verified tools/agents/servers]

**Quality Assurance Applied**:
- [Security scans]: semgrep, gitleaks, actionlint
- [Performance]: Playwright metrics, build optimization
- [Integration]: Cross-system validation
- [Documentation]: Context7 patterns applied

**Task Execution**: [Proceed with verified and optimized approach]
```

### Collaborative Feedback Loop:
1. **Acknowledge ChatGPT-5's Analysis**: "Thanks for the comprehensive guidance!"
2. **Confirm Resource Availability**: "All recommended tools/agents/servers verified"
3. **Report Optimization Applied**: "Applied additional optimizations based on current environment"
4. **Execute with Excellence**: Use validated approach for optimal results
5. **Provide Execution Feedback**: Share results for continuous improvement

## ERROR HANDLING & FALLBACK PROTOCOLS

### When ChatGPT-5 Recommendations Need Adjustment:

**If Tools Are Unavailable**:
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tool Adjustment Required

ChatGPT-5 recommended: [unavailable tool]
Alternative approach: [available equivalent]
Proceeding with: [adjusted methodology]
```

**If Sub-Agents Are Inaccessible**:
```markdown
## üîÑ Agent Substitution Applied

Requested agent: [unavailable agent]
Using alternative: [available agent with similar capabilities]
Adjusted approach: [modified methodology]
```

**If MCP Servers Are Down**:
```markdown
## üîß Fallback Strategy Activated

Requested server: [unavailable server]
Fallback method: [alternative approach]
Quality maintained: [verification of equivalent results]
```

---

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT INTEGRATION

### Learning from Collaboration:
1. **Track Success Patterns**: Document effective tool/agent/server combinations
2. **Identify Optimization Opportunities**: Note performance improvements
3. **Update Best Practices**: Refine integration patterns
4. **Share Insights**: Provide feedback to improve ChatGPT-5's recommendations
5. **Evolve Collaboration**: Enhance teamwork effectiveness over time

### Feedback to ChatGPT-5:
- **Successful Patterns**: "The [tool + agent + server] combination worked perfectly!"
- **Performance Insights**: "Adding [optimization] improved execution time by 40%"
- **New Discoveries**: "Found [new integration pattern] that enhances results"
- **Environment Updates**: "Tool [X] updated to version [Y] with new capabilities"
