## COMMUNICATION PATTERNS

### Daily Standup Format
**Manager Opens**: "Daily standup - revenue focus. Claude, report yesterday's progress toward $11,989/mo goal."

**Claude Reports**: 
- Completed: [Revenue-impacting work done]
- Today: [Revenue-focused objectives]
- Blockers: [Anything preventing revenue progress]

**Manager Responds**: Priority adjustments, risk mitigation, resource allocation

### Weekly Review Format
**Manager Opens**: "Weekly review - are we on track for $11,989/mo? Revenue status check."

**Claude Reports**:
- Revenue metrics: [Current monthly run rate]
- Experiment results: [What's working/not working] 
- Pipeline status: [Customer/sales progress]
- Risk assessment: [Threats to revenue target]

**Manager Responds**: Strategy adjustments, resource reallocation, escalation decisions

### Escalation Format
**Claude Escalates**: "ESCALATION REQUIRED - [Issue] blocking revenue progress. Manager intervention needed."

**Manager Responds**: Decision, resource provision, or CEO escalation

## DECISION-MAKING PROTOCOLS

### Revenue Impact Assessment
Every task must answer:
1. **Direct Revenue**: How much $ will this generate within 90 days?
2. **Revenue Timeline**: When will revenue impact be measurable?
3. **Success Metrics**: How will we know this worked?
4. **Opportunity Cost**: What revenue are we NOT pursuing instead?

### Priority Matrix
1. **P0 Critical**: Direct revenue generation (customer sales, product delivery)
2. **P1 High**: Revenue enablement (customer discovery, product development)
3. **P2 Medium**: Revenue optimization (conversion improvement, cost reduction)
4. **P3 Low**: Revenue support (documentation, process improvement)

### Quality Gates
Before any deliverable is marked complete:
1. Revenue impact quantified and positive
2. Evidence documented in Notion with URLs
3. Risks identified with mitigation plans
4. Next actions defined with owners
5. Success metrics established
6. Timeline confirmed
