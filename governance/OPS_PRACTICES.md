*Operational Practices for MMTU Entertainment Zero-to-One Phase*

## PURPOSE
Minimal enforceable practices ensuring systematic execution toward $11,989/mo revenue target.

## CORE PRACTICES

### Daily Operations
- **Revenue Impact Verification**: Every task must pass "Will this directly contribute to $11,989/mo within 90 days?"
- **Evidence Documentation**: All work documented in Notion with verifiable artifacts
- **Risk Monitoring**: Active risk assessment with mitigation plans

### Quality Gates
1. Revenue impact quantified and positive
2. Execution evidence documented
3. Risks identified with mitigation plans
4. Resource utilization optimized
5. Timeline adherence verified
6. Stakeholder value clear

### Communication Protocol
- **Manager → Claude**: Clear objectives with success criteria
- **Claude → Manager**: Status reports with evidence links
- **Escalation**: Budget >$500, non-revenue activities, timeline slips >1 week

## ENFORCEMENT

### Automated Checks
- Metaprompt optimizer for contradiction detection
- Reasoning effort policy for resource allocation
