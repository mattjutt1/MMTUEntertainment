## ⚠️ Risk Assessment & Mitigation Matrix

### 🔴 HIGH RISK (Immediate Attention)
```yaml
GitHub API Rate Limits:
  Risk: 15,000 req/hour = 4.2 req/sec maximum
  Impact: Service degradation for high-volume enterprise customers
  Probability: High (guaranteed constraint)
  Mitigation Strategy:
    ✅ Request queuing with Workers KV
    ✅ Check run deduplication by commit SHA
    ✅ Batch operations for multiple repos
    ✅ Real-time rate limit monitoring
    ✅ Enterprise customer tier management
  
Secondary Rate Limits:  
  Risk: 100 concurrent requests maximum
  Impact: Request failures during traffic spikes
  Probability: Medium (depends on usage patterns)
  Mitigation Strategy:
    ✅ Connection pooling implementation
    ✅ Exponential backoff retry logic
    ✅ Circuit breaker pattern
    ✅ Request queue with priority levels
```

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK (Monitor & Plan)
```yaml
Webhook Security:
  Risk: Stripe webhook signature validation failure
  Impact: Payment fraud vulnerability
  Probability: Low (implementation dependent)
  Mitigation Strategy:
    ✅ Use stripe.webhooks.constructEvent() verified method
    ✅ Implement comprehensive error logging
    ✅ Test with Stripe CLI webhook simulation
    ✅ Monitor webhook delivery success rates

Database Scaling:
  Risk: Supabase connection limits with high concurrency
  Impact: Database connection exhaustion
  Probability: Medium (growth dependent)  
  Mitigation Strategy:
    ✅ Connection pooling configuration
    ✅ Proper connection cleanup in Workers
    ✅ Database performance monitoring
    ✅ Horizontal scaling with read replicas
```

### 🟢 LOW RISK (Standard Monitoring)
```yaml
Memory Constraints:
  Risk: 128MB free tier memory limit
  Impact: OOM errors processing large CTRF files
  Probability: Low (upgrade available)
  Mitigation Strategy:
    ✅ Stream processing for large files
    ✅ R2 temporary storage for chunked processing
    ✅ Memory usage monitoring and alerting
    ✅ Automatic upgrade to 512MB paid tier

Cold Start Performance:
  Risk: >100ms cold start affecting UX
  Impact: Perceived performance degradation
  Probability: Low (Workers optimization)
  Mitigation Strategy:
    ✅ Bundle size optimization (<130KB)
    ✅ Tree-shaking unused dependencies
    ✅ Scheduled Workers for warming
    ✅ CDN optimization for static assets
```
